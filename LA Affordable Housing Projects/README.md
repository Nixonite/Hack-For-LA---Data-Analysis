### Qualifier / Status (as of 11/5/15)
I just started this project on Nov. 4, 2015, but I hope to complete it by Nov. 8, 2015. For better examples of my capacity for market research and data science, [please see the other directories in this repo](http://bit.ly/1LwfHq7).

### Introduction
This is an analysis of how well L.A. City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund is doing at meeting resident need for affordable housing. In addition to descriptive stats comparing needs to investment, it employs inferential stats to determine whether there have been any biases in resource allocation, per council district, to date.

### Data Analysis

We'll begin with a few exploratory analyses, with plots, and then up-shift to more advanced, inferential statistics.

#### Development vs. Need

Let's see how much L.A. City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund has invested in housing projects since 2003, first by total spend, then by project count.
